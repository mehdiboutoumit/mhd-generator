## Overview

`mhd-generator` is a powerful and flexible project generator designed to streamline the process of creating React and Angular projects with desired pre-configurations. This tool aims to simplify the initial setup and configuration, allowing developers to focus more on building features rather than setting up their projects.

## Features

- Generate React projects with pre-configured setups.
- Generate Angular projects with desired configurations.
- Easy-to-use CLI interface.
- Customizable templates for various project needs.
- Open-source and actively maintained.

```

## Usage
